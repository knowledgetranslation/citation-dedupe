Outflow veins in the lesions were well developed under the capsule, narrowed just beneath the capsule, and dilated within the capsule. Both VI and CI were observed at the poststenotic intracapsular dilated part of outflow veins. The tumor tissue extended along the intracapsular horizontal veins which flowed in parallel with the capsule in VI, or along the vertical veins which directly flowed outside the capsule in CI. There was tumor tissue in the subendothelial layer of the outflow veins within the capsule. Intravascular tumor nests and nodular lesions within the capsule continued from the main tumors. It can be concluded from these results that most VI and CI may not be true invasions but pre-invasive lesions.\",\n        \"accession_number\": \"11422803\",\n        \"alternate_title\": \"Pathol Int\",\n        \"author\": \"Aida, N.\\rYamada, N.\\rAsano, G.\\rTanaka, S.\",\n        \"author_address\": \"Second Department of Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan. naritaka@nms.ac.jp\",\n        \"database_provider\": \"Ovid Technologies\",\n        \"date\": \"\",\n        \"id\": 11421,\n        \"isbn\": \"1320-5463\",\n        \"keywords\": \"0 (von Willebrand Factor)\",\n        \"language\": \"English\",\n        \"name_of_database\": \"MEDLINE\",\n        \"notes\": \"Aida, N\\\\\\\\rYamada, N\\\\\\\\rAsano, G\\\\\\\\rTanaka, S\",\n        \"number\": \"6\",\n        \"pages\": \"425-30\",\n        \"reference_type\": \"17\",\n        \"secondary_title\": \"Pathology International\",\n        \"title\": \"3-D analysis of vascular and capsular invasion in thyroid follicular carcinoma\",\n        \"url\": \"http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med4&AN=11422803\\rhttp://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rfr_id=info:sid/Ovid:med4&rft.genre=article&rft_id=info:doi/&rft_id=info:pmid/11422803&rft.issn=1320-5463&rft.volume=51&rft.issue=6&rft.spage=425&rft.pages=425-30&rft.date=2001&rft.jtitle=Pathology+International&rft.atitle=3-D+analysis+of+vascular+and+capsular+invasion+in+thyroid+follicular+carcinoma.&rft.aulast=Aida\",\n        \"volume\": \"51\",\n        \"year\": \"2001\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"abstract\": \"The diagnosis and staging of lung cancer often begins with the assessment of a suspect peripheral chest site.

Twelve patients were included in this analysis. Four plans for each patient were compared in terms of dose-volume histograms, homogeneity index (HI), and conformity index (CI): (1) 3 equispaced beam arrangement 3D-RT; (2) 4 equispaced beam arrangement 3D-RT; (3) 5 equispaced beam arrangement 3D-RT; (4) step-and-shoot IMRT technique. CI showed a good discrimination between the four plans. The mean scores of CI were 0.58 (range: 0.38-0.67) for the 3F-CRT plan, 0.58 (range: 0.41-0.66) for 4F-CRT, 0.62 (range: 0.43-0.68) for 5F-CRT and 0.69 (range: 0.58-0.78) for the IMRT plan. A significant improvement of the conformity was reached by the IMRT plan (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). As expected, the increment of 3D-CRT fields was associated with an improvement of target dose conformity and homogeneity; on the contrary, in the IMRT plans, a better conformity was associated to a worse target dose homogeneity. A significant reduction in terms of D(mean), V90%, V95%, V100% was recorded for rectal and bladder irradiation with the IMRT plan. Surprisingly, IMRT supplied a significant dose reduction also for rectum and bladder V30% and V50%. A significant dosimetric advantage of IMRT over 3D-RT in the adjuvant treatment of vaginal vault alone in terms of treatment conformity and rectum and bladder sparing is shown. 2010 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists.
